##This paper analyzes the method and thinking of the application of recurrent neural network to stock price prediction. In the introduction part, the development of neural network and the structure and algorithm of recurrent neural network are introduced. In the empirical part, a model for empirical analysis is designed based on Long-Short Term Memory network. The model has a small deviation between the predicted results of NASDAQ index and the real values. After the optimization of the model with grid search method, the prediction effect is significantly improved, which verifies that the cyclic neural network can predict the stock price Feasibility and potential.
